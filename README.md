# **Bear Hunt Strategy Optimization – Whiteout Survival**

This is an ongoing personal project focused on optimizing performance in the “Bear Hunt” event from the mobile game Whiteout Survival. Since the game does not offer a public API, I am currently in the data collection stage, using manual logs to capture information about rallies, troop deployments, and milestone progression. 

#### Planned objectives:
1) **Rally Prioritization:** Identify which rally types yield the best reward-to-effort outcomes.
2) **Deployment Optimization:** Develop a strategy to assign troops across 7 deployments for maximum damage efficiency.
3) **Milestone Forecasting:** Predict when all event milestones will be achieved using progress trends and damage estimates.
4) **Performance Tracking Dashboard:** Build a simple dashboard that shows the total damage by deployment, the damage per rally initiator, and milestone progress over time.
5) **Damage Forecasting:** Use a time series or regression model to predict the damage dealt in upcoming rallies.
